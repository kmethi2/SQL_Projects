Description: In this project, I took in a dataset of over 2000 records of company layoffs over the years 2020 and 2023. First, I cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, standardizing the dataset, fixing null/blank values and removing unneccesary rows and columns. Next, I ran some exploratory data analysis on the final dataset including looking at layoff totals and percentages by company, industry and also ranking them as well.
